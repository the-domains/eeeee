Ya boy Eric here. Not sure what to use this for so I think I'll use it for blogging about things I read/watch/listen to online (for now).

Currently listening to my first episode of [Hello, Internet][0] at the recommendation of everybody. I like it enough so far, not sure it's going to be a fixture of my listening habits but I'm still listening 1.5hrs into my first episode, so who knows.

Alright gonna publish this and see if the AI makes this into something neat.
